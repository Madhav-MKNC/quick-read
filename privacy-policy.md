*Privacy Policy for Bionic Reader*

Effective Date: 08 Jan 2025

At Bionic Reader, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share while using our extension. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and how we ensure your information remains secure.

1. Information We Collect
Bionic Reader does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not gather or store any user data, such as names, email addresses, or browsing history.

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only processes the text you select on the active tab to apply the bionic reading format (bolding the first 30% of each word).

2. How We Use Your Data
We do not store or share any data. The text you select is only processed locally on your device to apply the bionic reading technique. No content is sent to external servers or stored anywhere outside of your browser.

3. Permissions
To provide its functionality, Bionic Reader requires certain permissions:

Active Tab: Allows the extension to access and modify content on the webpage you are currently viewing.
Host Permission: Grants the extension the ability to convert selected text to the bionic format across all websites you visit.
These permissions are required solely to deliver the extension's core feature of converting selected text to bionic format and do not involve data collection or tracking.

4. Data Security
We do not store any user data, and as a result, there is nothing for us to protect. All processing happens locally on your device, ensuring that your data stays private and secure.

5. Third-Party Services
Bionic Reader does not use third-party analytics or tracking services. The extension functions solely on the device it is installed on and does not interact with external servers for any data processing.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any changes are made, they will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
